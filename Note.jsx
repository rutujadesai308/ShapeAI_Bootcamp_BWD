        This was an amazing bootcamp taken by Shaurya Sinha. Everything was
        taken from scratch. It was amazing learning with you. All the basics of
        HTML were also cleared. The examples you gave while teaching were so
        realistic and understandable. Thank you so much Shaurya Sir and Shape AI
        for this amazing Bootcamp.
